# CIMCYC Workshop on Computational modelling of behavioral data

## What is this workshop about?
After two decades of success of neuroimaging techniques, we are witnessing a growing popularity of approaches that aim at a better characterization of behavioral data in psychological experiments. Such characterization tries to offer a greater understanding of the effects of our manipulations on behavior (and the brain), beyond the important but somewhat limited insight we can gain from looking at mean reaction times and error rates. This workshop aims at providing an entry point for early career researchers into the field of computational modelling for cognitive science.
